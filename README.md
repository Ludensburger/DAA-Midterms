**DAA-Midterms Compilation**

Project Title: Programming Lessons Compilation
This project is a compilation of various programming lessons and tasks that have been implemented. It serves as a practical application of the concepts learned during the lessons.

Features
The program includes the following features:

Josephus Problem: This feature allows the user to solve the Josephus problem. The user inputs the total population and the number of skips, and the program outputs the position that survives.

Merge Sort: This feature allows the user to sort an array of integers using the merge sort algorithm. The user inputs the size of the array and the elements of the array, and the program outputs the sorted array.

How to Run
To run the program, compile the main.c file using a C compiler and then run the resulting executable. For example, if you're using the GCC compiler, you can use the following commands:

gcc main.c -o main
./main

How to Use
After running the program, follow the prompts to use each feature. For the Josephus problem, enter the total population and the number of skips when prompted. For the merge sort feature, enter the size of the array and the elements of the array when prompted.

Future Work
Future updates may include additional features based on upcoming lessons and tasks.
